# Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The following are the variables within the `penguins` dataset.

- `species`: either “Adelie”, “Chinstrap”, or “Gentoo”
- `island`: either “Biscoe”, “Dream”, or “Torgersen”
- `bill_length_mm`: bill length in mm
- `bill_depth_mm`: bill depth in mm
- `flipper_length_mm`: flipper length in mm
- `body_mass_g`: body mass in grams
- `sex`: either male or female
- `year`: either 2007, 2008, or 2009

The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns.

``` r
flipper_length = penguins$flipper_length_mm
mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm.

The scatterplot of `flipper_length_mm` versus `bill_length_mm` is shown
below, with points colored by `species`.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

The dataframe is created below.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
variable_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "high", "low", "low", "medium", "medium"))
)

show(variable_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_numeric vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1       0.560 TRUE        a        low       
    ##  2      -0.745 FALSE       b        medium    
    ##  3      -1.47  FALSE       c        low       
    ##  4      -0.821 FALSE       d        medium    
    ##  5       1.03  TRUE        e        high      
    ##  6       0.368 TRUE        f        high      
    ##  7       0.490 TRUE        g        low       
    ##  8      -0.695 FALSE       h        low       
    ##  9      -0.839 FALSE       i        medium    
    ## 10       0.411 TRUE        j        medium

The means of each variable is taken below. The mean is correctly
calculated for `vec_numeric` since these are numbers, and is correctly
calculated for `vec_logical` since `TRUE` and `FALSE` are coded as 1 and
0, respectively. However, the mean is not calculated for `vec_char` and
`vec_factor` since these are stored as text and the `mean()` function
requires numeric values.

``` r
mean(pull(variable_df, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] -0.1708535

``` r
mean(pull(variable_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(variable_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(variable_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(variable_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(variable_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

If the `as.numeric()` function is applied, then `vec_logical` is
correctly understood as either 1 or 0. For `vec_char`, the function
results in `NA` since it is not defined what a character represents
numerically. For `vec_factor`, the function results in unique numbers
corresponding to each factor, although there is not a apparent order or
pattern to how the numbers are corresponded, again since R does not
understand the ordered meaning of text. These results explain why the
mean function worked well for the logical vector, but couldn’t work for
the character or factor vectors.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(variable_df, vec_logical))
```

``` r
as.numeric(pull(variable_df, vec_char))
```

``` r
as.numeric(pull(variable_df, vec_factor))
```
